trading plan

Futures do not trade in shares as stocks do, rather they trade in standardized 
contracts. Each futures contract has a standard size that has been set by the 
futures exchange on which it trades. As an example, the contract size for gold 
futures is 100 troy ounces. That means when you buy 1 contract of gold futures, 
you have control of 100 troy ounces of gold. If the price of gold were to move $1 
higher, it would result in a profit of $100 ($1 x 100 ounces). A new trader needs to 
become familiar with each commodity and futures contract since the quantity of 
different futures varies.
